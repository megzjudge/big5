                    <p class="pcenter">1.0 = 100% correlation, 0.7 = 70% correlation, etc.
                    <br>-1.0 would also be an extremely strong correlation, means its definitely tied to it in the opposite direction.</p>

                <section class="page">
                    <h2>Test - Where</h2>
                    <p class="plimited">The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Five_personality_traits" target="_blank">Big 5 Personality Test</a>, also called OCEAN, is a core psychology test which would be given to you by a psychologists if you wanted a personality test conducted. It is the default test used today by psychologists since when it was developed in the 1980s. These results I am showing use the Big 10 model, which is an "extended version" of the main big 5, there is the big 2-5-10-30.</p>
                    <p class="plimited">The test I took was made by <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jordan-Peterson-9" target="_blank">Jordan Peterson</a> and is available for like $10 on his <a href="https://www.understandmyself.com/personality-assessment" target="_blank">website</a>. It can be found free all over the internet, but his version of the test as the big 10 model is my preferred personally and the website keeps your records, you can pair your account with your partners and it gives you a secondary report, etc. A great free version of the big 5 is available after the first personality test on the social scientist Jonathan Haidt's <a href="https://yourmorals.org/" target="_blank">website</a> also.</p>
                </section>

                <section class="page">
                    <h2>Test - About</h2>
                    <p class="plimited">The test is fundamentally split into <b>5 areas</b>, which have <b>2 sections</b> each. A <b>higher</b> percentage means the default trait exhibits more in the personality, a <b>lower</b> percentage means the person uses this feature less in their psyche. The descriptions are split into Exceptionally High, Very High, Moderately High, High, Average, Low, Moderately Low, Very Low, and Exceptionally Low for how each trait enacts in a person.</p>
                    <p class="plimited">The understandmyself test version also gives comparisons to all other test takers for the average. Ie, average % for women, average % for men, so you can see how different you are from the general population of hundreds and thousands of test takers - many people, like me, have bought it for family members and etc so the pool is varied which is where I am pulling those statistics from in the bars.</p>
